          Why We need to Use Angular Boilerplate?
        </h2>
      </nb-card-header>

      <nb-card-body>
        <p>
          A boilerplate serves as a foundation or starting point for a project,
          providing a set of predefined files, configurations, and code snippets
          that developers can use to kick-start their development process. Here
          are several reasons why boilerplates are valuable:
        </p>
        <div class="list-wrapper">
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Time Efficiency:</strong> Boilerplates save time by
              eliminating the need to set up project configurations and
              structures from scratch. Developers can quickly get started with
              building features and functionalities instead of spending time on
              repetitive setup tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consistency:</strong> Boilerplates promote consistency
              across projects by enforcing best practices, coding standards, and
              architectural patterns. This consistency makes it easier for
              developers to understand and collaborate on projects, especially
              in team environments.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reduced Errors:</strong> With a boilerplate, developers
              can avoid common configuration errors and pitfalls associated with
              starting a project from scratch. The boilerplate often includes
              preconfigured settings and dependencies that are known to work
              well together.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Scalability:</strong> Boilerplates provide a scalable
              foundation for projects of varying complexity. Developers can
              easily add or remove features, refactor code, and scale the
              application as needed, without worrying about fundamental setup
              issues.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Learning Curve Reduction:</strong> For developers new to a
              particular technology stack or framework, boilerplates serve as
              learning aids. They provide a structured starting point and
              examples of best practices, helping developers understand how to
              organize their code and implement common functionalities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Standardization:</strong> Within organizations or
              communities, boilerplates establish standards and conventions for
              project setup and development practices. This standardization
              simplifies onboarding for new team members and ensures consistency
              across projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Community Support:</strong> Many popular frameworks and
              libraries have community-maintained boilerplates tailored to
              specific use cases. Leveraging these boilerplates allows
              developers to benefit from community expertise, receive updates,
              and access community support resources.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rapid Prototyping:</strong> When building prototypes or
              minimum viable products (MVPs), boilerplates provide a quick and
              efficient way to get a functional application up and running.
              Developers can focus on implementing core features and validating
              ideas without getting bogged down in setup details.
