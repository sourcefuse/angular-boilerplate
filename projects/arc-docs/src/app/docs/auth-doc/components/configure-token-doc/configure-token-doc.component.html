            At this step,It's time to get a user token but primarly we need a
            code with the help of code we call getToken API which returns a
            token, after a successful authentication to be able to communicate
            with the server and, for instance, show username in the header of
            the application
          </li>
          <li>
            Let's assume that your backend returns a JWT token so that we can
            use the token payload to extract user info out of it. Each Strategy
            specifies which token class is going to be used by default.
          </li>
          <li>
            For example, NbPasswordAuthStrategy uses AuthToken, and AuthProvider
            . It is also possible to specify another token class if it is
            required.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When we get token we call authorise method, The authorize method is
          part of an authentication service. It is designed to handle the
          authorization process using a provided secret (such as an
          authorization code). This method initiates a command to obtain tokens,
          processes the response, and navigates the user based on the
          authorization result.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Process Response:If the response contains an access token and a
            refresh token: Save the tokens and their expiry. Navigate the user
            to the last accessed URL or the home path.Return true indicating
            successful authorization.
          </li>
          <li>If tokens are not received, return false</li>
