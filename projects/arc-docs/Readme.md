# Arc- Docs

## Description

The documentation for the arc-docs project is not explicitly detailed in the provided context. However, based on the structure and purpose of the boilerplate, we can infer that the arc-docs project is likely intended for documentation purposes related to the applications and libraries within the Angular workspace.

## Purpose

The main objectives of the `arc-docs` project are:

- To offer clear and accessible documentation for each application and library within the ARC workspace.
- To provide user guides and best practices for developers working with the ARC Angular boilerplate.
- To facilitate the generation of API documentation for shared libraries using tools like Compodoc.
- To serve as a centralized resource for all project-related documentation.

## Getting Started

In a typical multi-project setup like this, a documentation project may serve the following purposes:

`Documentation Generation`: It may be used to generate and host documentation for the various applications and shared libraries (like arc-lib) within the workspace.

`User Guides`: It could provide user guides, tutorials, and usage examples for developers and users of the applications.

`Centralized Information` : It may serve as a centralized location for all documentation related to the projects in the workspace, making it easier for developers to find information.

If you need more precise information, please check the arc-docs folder in the project structure or refer to any related documentation that may have been included with the boilerplate.
