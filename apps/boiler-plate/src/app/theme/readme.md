# Theme module

- Theme module in our micro service is usually used in conjunction with Nebular,Nebular is a customizable Angular UI Library and styles designed to create a consistent, modern user interface. Nebular includes a set of pre-defined themes, but you can also create your own custom themes also.

- Once you have created your theme module, you can import it into your application's main module or any other module that needs to use the styles defined in the theme. You can also use the nebular service to switch between different themes at runtime, allowing users to choose their preferred theme

# IconPacksManagerService

- "IconPacksManagerService" that is used to manage and register various icon packs for an Angular application that is using the Nebular theme library.

- The service class imports the "NbIconLibraries" class from the Nebular theme library and the "ThemeModule" from the application's theme module. It also imports SVG icons which are presumably used in the application. & also we can add custum SVG icons and modify accordingly as per user needs
  The service class has three methods:

`registerFontAwesome()` which registers the "font-awesome" icon pack using the "registerFontPack()" method of "NbIconLibraries". The iconClassPrefix "fa" is provided as a parameter which will be used to prefix all icon classes in the "font-awesome" pack.

`registerPack(name, params)` which registers a custom icon pack with the provided name and parameters using the "registerFontPack()" method of "NbIconLibraries". The "params" object is an optional parameter which contains the iconClassPrefix.

`registerSvgs()` which registers a custom SVG icon pack called "svg-boiler" using the "registerSvgPack()" method of "NbIconLibraries". The pack contains SVG icon "kebab", which are passed as objects to the "registerSvgPack()" method.

# Styles

In styles we have all the files which we are using for styling and designing the data in presentable way for this we are using these files named 'mixins','utilities','variables' and 'dhtmlx_gantt' These all are the collection of Sass files can be used to quickly add styles to HTML elements.for example we are using padding,width,height,margin,color-cases,font-size,alignment etc

# Toaster

- ToasterService:

We are using ToasterService that provides methods to display toasts using the NbToastrService and
The ToasterService provides the methods to show different types of toasts like show: shows a generic toast,success: shows a success toast,info: shows an info toast ,warn: shows a warning toast,error: shows an error toast .Each of these methods takes a message and an optional title, and a configuration object that can be used to customize the appearance and behavior of the toast.

- ToasterAdapterService:

In our microservice ToasterAdapterService implements the "IAdapter" interface for converting between two different types of objects: "ToasterConfigExt" and "NbToastrConfig".

- "ngx-toastr" which provides a toast notification service for Angular applications. It allows you to configure various options for the toast notifications, including their appearance, position, duration, and behavior. The library provides a "ToastrConfig" class that you can use to set these options globally for your application or on a per-toast basis.

- NbToastrConfig is a configuration service provided by the Nebular UI library, which is used to customize the appearance and behavior of toast notifications.
